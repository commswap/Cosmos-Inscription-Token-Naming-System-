## Examples
```
bt:DISPENSER|0|COSS|1|1|BTC|1.00000000|0|cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv
This example creates a dispenser and escrows 1 COSS `token` in it, which will dispense when 1.00000000 BTC is sent to cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv
```

```
bt:DISPENSER|0|COSS|1|1|BTC|1.00000000|10
This example closes the dispenser in example 1 and credits any escrowed COSS to the dispenser address cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv
```

```
bt:DISPENSER|0|BRRR|1000|1COSS1|0|cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv
This example creates a dispenser and escrows 1000 BRRR `token` in it, which will dispense when 1 TEST `token` is sent to cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv
```

```
bt:DISPENSER|0|BRRR|1000|1COSS1|0|cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv
This example closes the dispenser in example 3 and credits any escrowed BRRR to the address 1BrrrrLLzVq8ZP1nE3BHKQZ14dBXkRVsx4
```


## Rules
- Dispensers can only be closed by the dispenser address

## Notes
- Can create a dispenser on any valid address (no new/empty address limitation like CP)
- `STATUS` changes to `10` when a dispener is closed
- `STATUS` changes to `10` automatically when a dispenser runs out of `tokens` to dispense
- `ORACLE_ADDRESS` option only works when `TRIGGER_TICK` is `BTC`
- When specifying an `ORACLE_ADDRESS`, `TRIGGER_AMOUNT` format becomes X.XX (fiat)
- The `ORACLE_ADDRESS` option uses the Counterparty oracle system
- Oracles require BTC to operate, and as such, collect a percentage (%) fee, which is determined by the `broadcast` `fee` value (0.01 = 1%)
- CITNS Dispensers that use `ORACLE_ADDRESS` pay the oracle the entire percentage (%) fee, at time of dispenser creation
- Dispenser payment can only trigger up to `25` sub-dispenses (dispenses that trigger additional dispenses)
