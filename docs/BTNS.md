# Abstract
Establish a new token naming system inspried by a J-Dog's BTNS 

# Motivation
Allow experimentation with an alternate token naming system

# Rationale
Counterparty BRC20 or other XRC20 Protocol has established a beautiful asset naming system which allows for registration of unique assets, but it canâ€™t handle a natural spelling with more flexible rules of ticker like lenght  and we want a new naming stardand which can run on top of any blockchain and write data on...BTC,ETH,DOGE,COSMOS,ETC,etc., a brand new multi-chain platform people could booking hotel,buy food,clothes with the token the like, a full chain-agnostic platform,the CITNS spec defines all the various platform ACTIONS and PARAMS in various formats, and the CITNS indexer parses/validates that data to determine what is valid and not. Let's start from Cosmos


This proposal establishes a new token naming system which will allow additional experimentation with "tokens" on Cosmos via broadcasting inscription.

By establishing 3 pre-defined broadcast formats, users can `DEPLOY`, `MINT`, and `TRANSFER` tokens. With these 3 functions we can create tokens, allow users to mint them in a decentralized "fair" way, and allow for the moving of these new tokens between addresses. 

This spec can be extended in the future to allow for additional options and formats.


Additional CITNS specs, indexers, and development tools are available at the official CITNS repo at: https://github.com/commswap/Cosmos-Inscription-Token-Naming-System

# Definitions

- `token` - A virtual token which was created via a `DEPLOY` or `MINT` format `broadcast` transaction
- `broadcast` - A general purpose transaction type which allows broadcasting of a message to the Counterparty platform
- `DEPLOY` - A specially formatted `broadcast` which registers a `token` name for usage
- `MINT` - A specially formatted `broadcast` which allows for creation/minting of token supply 
- `TRANSFER` - A specially formatted `broadcast` which can move a `token` between users

# Specification
This spec defines 3 formats `DEPLOY`, `MINT`, and `TRANSFER` which will allow for creation of tokens, supply, and sending between users

## Project Prefix
In order for different projects to experiment with features in the Cosmos Inscription Token naming System (CITNS) and not collide with one another, each project should establish a unique prefix for their project to use in their broadcasts.

The default CITNS prefix which should be used for CITNS transactions is `CITNS` and `BT`. All CITNS actions will begin with `CITNS:` or `bt:` (case insensitive)

## Project Versioning
Blockchain development moves fast, and quite often there is a need to change specs and switch to a new version immediately. The CITNS has a novel way of handling versioning, by using the `broadcast` `value` field to indicate what version of a spec a CITNS `broadcast` is using.

The default CITNS version is `0` when no `broadcast` `value` is specified

To specify a specific version of a CITNS spec, you can specify the version number in the `broadcast` `value` field

## `DEPLOY` format
This format allows one to create a token and specify the following information about it

- `TICK` - 1 to 1024 characters in length (see rules below ) (required)
- `MAX_SUPPLY` - Maximum token supply (max: 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 - commas not allowed)
- `MAX_MINT` - Maximum amount of supply a `MINT` transaction can issue
- `DECIMALS` - Number of decimal places token should have (max: 18, default: 0)
- `ICON` - URL to a an icon to use for this token (48x48 standard size)
- `MINT_SUPPLY` - Amount of token supply to mint in immediately (default:0)
- `TRANSFER` - Address to transfer ownership of the `token` to (owner can perform future actions on token)
- `TRANSFER_SUPPLY` - Address to transfer `MINT_SUPPLY` to (mint initial supply and transfer to address)

**Broadcast Format:**
`bt:DEPLOY|TICK|MAX_SUPPLY|MAX_MINT|DECIMALS|ICON|MINT_SUPPLY|TRANSFER|TRANSFER_SUPPLY`

**Example 1:**
`bt:DEPLOY|COSS|1000|1|0`
The above example issues a COSS token with a max supply of 1000, and a maximum mint of 1 COSS per `MINT`

**Example 2:**
`bt:DEPLOY|COSS|1000|1|0|http://commswap.com/images/COSS_icon.png`
The above example issues a COSS token with a max supply of 1000, and a maximum mint of 1 COSS per `MINT` and associates an `ICON` with the `token`

**Example 3:**
`bt:DEPLOY|BRRR|10000000000000000000|10000000000000|0|https://commswap.com/images/BRRR_icon.png|100`
The above example issues a BRRR token with a max supply of 1 Quandrillion supply and a maximum mint of 1 Trillion BRRR per `MINT`, associates an `ICON` with the `token`, and immediately mints 100 BRRR to the broadcasting address.

**Example 4:**
`bt:DEPLOYCOSS100|1|0||1|cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv|cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv`
The above example issues a TEST token with a max supply of 100, and a maximum mint of 1 TEST per `MINT`. This also mints 1 TEST token, and transfers ownership AND initial token supply to cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv

### Rules
- `broadcast` `status` must be `valid`
- First `TICK` `DEPLOY` will be considered as valid.
- Additional `TICK` `DEPLOY` transactions after first valid `TICK` `DEPLOY`, will be considered invalid and ignored, unless broadcast from `token` owners address
- If `TICK` contains any unicode characters, then `TICK` should be `base64` encoded
- Allowed characters in `TICK`:
   - Any word character (alphanumeric characters and underscores)
   - Special characters: ~!@#$%^&*()_+\-={}[\]\\:<>.?/
   - empty space
   - Most printable emojis in U+1F300 to U+1F5FF
- Special characters pipe `|` and semicolon `;` are **NOT** to be used in `TICK` names 

## `MINT` format
This format allows one to mint token supply

- `TICK` - `token` name registered with `DEPLOY` format (required)
- `AMOUNT` - Amount of tokens to mint (required)
- `DESTINATION` - Address to transfer tokens to

**Broadcast Format:**
`bt:MINT|TICK|AMOUNT|DESTINATION`

**Example 1:**
`bt:MINT|COSS|1`
The above example mints 1 COSS `token` to the broadcasting address

**Example 2:**
`bt:MINT|BRRR|10000000000000|cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv`
The above example mints 10,000,000,000,000 BRRR tokens and transfers them to cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv 

### Rules
- `broadcast` `status` must be `valid`
- `token` supply may be minted until `MAX_SUPPLY` is reached.
- Transactions that attempt to mint supply beyond `MAX_SUPPLY` shall be considered invalid and ignored.


## `TRANSFER` format
This format allows one to transfer or send a `token` between addresses

- `TICK` - `token` name registered with `DEPLOY` format (required)
- `AMOUNT` - Amount of tokens to send (required)
- `DESTINATION` - Address to transfer tokens to (required)

This format also allows for repeating `AMOUNT` and `DESTINATION` to enable multiple transfers in a single transaction

**Broadcast Format:**
`bt:TRANSFER|TICK|AMOUNT|DESTINATION`

**Broadcast Format2:**
`bt:TRANSFER|TICK|AMOUNT|DESTINATION|AMOUNT|DESTINATION`

**Broadcast Format3:**
`bt:TRANSFER|TICK|AMOUNT|DESTINATION|TICK|AMOUNT|DESTINATION`

**Example 1:**
`bt:TRANSFER|COSS|1|cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv`
The above example sends 1 COSS token to cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv

**Example 2:**
`bt:TRANSFER|BRRR|5|cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv`
The above example sends 5 BRRR tokens to cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv

**Example 3:**
`bt:TRANSFER|BRRR|5|cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv|1|1BoogrfDADPLQpq8LMASmWQUVYDp4t2hF9`
The above example sends 5 BRRR tokens to cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv and 1 BRRR token to 1BoogrfDADPLQpq8LMASmWQUVYDp4t2hF9

**Example 4:**
`bt:TRANSFER|BRRR|5|cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrvCOSS1|1BoogrfDADPLQpq8LMASmWQUVYDp4t2hF9`
The above example sends 5 BRRR tokens to cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv and 1 TEST token to 1BoogrfDADPLQpq8LMASmWQUVYDp4t2hF9

### Rules
- `broadcast` `status` must be `valid`
- A `token` transfer shall only be considered valid if the broacasting address has balances of the `token` to cover the transfer `AMOUNT`
- A `token` transfer that does _not_ have `AMOUNT` in the broadcasting address shall be considered invalid and ignored.
- A valid `token` transfer will deduct the `token` `AMOUNT` from the broadcasting addresses balances
- A valid `token` tranfer will credit the `token` `AMOUNT` to the `DESTINATION` address or addresses
