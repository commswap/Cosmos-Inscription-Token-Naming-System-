# Cosmos Inscription Token Naming System (CITNS)

This is the official repository for Cosmos Inscription Token Naming System (**`CITNS`**). 

The **`CITNS`** operates on the **`Cosmos`** or **`other blockchains`** platforms using the Cosmos `inscription` feature. 

The **`CITNS`** support the **`BRC20`** ordinals assets using the `ordinals` feature. 

**`CITNS`** and **`CITNS-420`** are **NOT** _officially_ endorsed by the **`Cosmos`** project. 

**`CITNS`** and **`CITNS-420`** is a **SINGLE** _platform_ that plugs into **`multiple`** chains backend.


This is a personal hobby project, to allow for experimentation with additional token features and functionality.

If you find this project interesting, please consider making a donation of **`ATOM`**, **`CITNS`** assets, or **`$COSS`** tokens to `cosmos1f0wvhastnvu3ynyspvv8de3rpe66jmhwtthdrv` to support continued experimentation.


# Disclaimer 
`CITNS` is a bleeding-edge experimental protocol to play around with token functionality on **`BRC20/Bitcoin `** and **`Cosmos`**. This is a hobby project, and  I am **NOT** responsible for any losses, financial or otherwise, incurred from using this experimental protocol and its functionality. 

Science is messy sometimes... _**DO NOT**_ put in funds your not willing to lose!
